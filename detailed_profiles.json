Increase (Dream Outcome \u00d7 Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) and decrease (Time Delay \u00d7 Effort/Sacrifice). Document failures; iterate fast; measure CAC payback and LTV/CAC. Diversify lead flow.\n\n    How they decide (principles & frameworks)\n    Frameworks: **Value Equation**; **Grand Slam Offer** (named promise, premiums/bonuses, scarcity/urgency, risk reversal); **Acquisition loop** (capture \u2192 nurture \u2192 convert \u2192 ascend).

Positioning: name a specific avatar + painful outcome; package into a category\u2011of\u2011one. Growth: content that repeats the same promise, direct\u2011response landing pages, testimonials, guarantees; obsession with follow\u2011up and objection handling; multi\u2011channel testing; CAC payback thresholds.\n\n    What they avoid (red flags & cautions)\n    Vague offers, slow time\u2011to\u2011value, \u201cone channel\u201d risk, guarantees that invite abuse, copying competitors\u2019 prices without value parity, ignoring payback math.\n\n    Personality & language (from talks/interviews)\n    Blunt and tactical; \u201cno BS.\u201d Uses metaphors (video game leveling, reps/sets); frequently says \u201cyou want to\u2026\u201d and \u201chere\u2019s the math.\u201d Self\u2011deprecating about past failures; emphasizes documentation and deliberate practice.
